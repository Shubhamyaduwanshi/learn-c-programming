/*
	An Indetifier can only have alphanumeric characters( a-z , A-Z , 0-9 ) and underscore( _ ). 
	The first character of an identifier can only contain alphabet( a-z , A-Z ) or underscore ( _ ). 
	Identifiers are also case sensitive in C. For example name and Name are two different identifier in C.

	Tips for Good Programming Practice :
		Programmer can choose the name of identifier whatever they want. 
		However, if the programmer choose meaningful name for an identifier, 
		it will be easy to understand and work on, particularly in case of large program.
